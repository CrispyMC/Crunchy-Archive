Basics
------
Crunchy inherits all licensing from upstream projects (Paper, Spigot and Bukkit). 

As such, Paper is licensed under the [GNU General Public License version 3](licenses/GPL-3.0.md); as it inherits it from Paper, who in turn inherits it 
from Spigot, who inherits it from Bukkit and CraftBukkit projects.

The application of the MIT within Paper does not apply to the Crunchy project.
